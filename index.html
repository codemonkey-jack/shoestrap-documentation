			<h1>The most versatile Bootstrap theme for <i class="el-icon-wordpress"></i> WordPress just got better!</h1>

			<p>We 've been rewriting the <a href="http://shoestrap.org">Shoestrap</a> theme for more than 2 months, making it better and even more versatile.</p>

			<p>As a result of the theme rewrite, a lot of things have changed and the previous docs we had available for developers are obsolete and no longer available.</p>

			<p>Please be patient as we rewrite them and bring them up to date.</p>
